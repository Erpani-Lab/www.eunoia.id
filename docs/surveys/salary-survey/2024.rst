Introduction

In a hurry? Jump straight to `Median salary`_ or `Median hourly rate`_.

.. IDEA: reorganization idea: put median salaries first, and then provide the background information that went into the median figures.

   .. rubric:: |icon-info| Note on independent contractors, freelancers and the self-employed

   In this year’s survey, we asked those who filled out the survey as independent contractors, freelancers or self-employed people what term they used to describe their type of employment. More than half (63.8%) preferred the term “contractor”, with only 18.1% using “freelancer” and 10.6% using “self-employed”. In this report, we’ll use the term “contractors” to refer to this entire group.

Feedback
--------

We're always keen to hear your thoughts on this survey, so that we can continue to develop and refine it - and if you have used the data to help negotiate a raise or evaluate an offer, we would love to know about it! Email us at support@writethedocs.org with your feedback, ideas and experiences. 

Here are just some of the anonymous comments that respondents submitted in 2024:

.. pull-quote::

   I used the results of this survey to ask for a raise a few years ago. It helped enormously - I got the most significant raise I've ever received!

   I negotiated a much higher salary bracket when hiring a new team member. Other (paid) salary calibrators don't have enough info for tech writers and the 'AI' estimates are always too low.

   Data from past years helped me understand how underpaid I was at the time and gave me confidence to negotiate with the next opportunity. 

   In 2025, I expect to convert from a contractor to a full-time employee. I fully expect that I will need to negotiate my salary and will lean heavily on the WTD Salary Survey to do so.

Employment parameters
=====================

This section establishes the parameters of the respondent's employment: the type of employment, number of hours worked, job title and type of role, length of time in current position, and how focused the role is on documentation. 

Basis of employment

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| In the past year, I have worked as:

   - an employee
   - a contractor
   - both employee and contractor

   |icon-question| As an employee, currently:

   - I'm employed
   - I'm not employed

   |icon-question| As a contractor, currently:

   - I have work
   - I don't have work

.. raw:: html

   </details>

As in previous surveys, employees made up the majority of respondents (686, or 87.9%). Contractors made up 8.5% (66 individuals).

For the first time this year, we included a third option - for respondents who had worked in the past year as both employee and contractor. 28 respondents (3.6%) chose this option, and provided both salary and contract rate data. This means that in total there are 714 employee responses and 94 contractor responses.

.. [*] Totals include 66 respondents who worked as both employee and contractor 

As in previous years, we encouraged those currently not working to respond as though still at their previous job/contract, provided they had worked at least some of the past year. 16 employees (2.3%) and 7 contractors (10.6%) filled out the survey on this basis.

Of the 28 respondents who had worked as both employee and contractor in the past year, 15 were currently working in both capacities. 9 were currently working as employee but not contractor, 2 were currently working as contractor but not as employee, and another 2 were not currently working in either capacity.

   <details><summary>Question background</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-info| Given that job titles and the responsibilities they entail varies widely, this question attempts to add context to the salary data by identifying the type of work being primarily performed. 
   
   We added the original version of this question - which asked respondents to broadly categorize their role into one of a limited set of options - in the second survey, in 2020. Starting in 2022, we allowed respondents to choose multiple role categories. This highlighted the breadth of talent in our community, but made comparing salaries more difficult.

   After community consultation in 2024, we split this question into two parts - one for primary role category, and one for additional roles - and expanded the number of options. 
   

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Primary role category
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Technical writer was by far the most widely-selected primary role category, chosen by 83.7% of respondents. Editor, DocOps and project/product manager counted for around 2% each. 

7 respondents selected "other" and provided more detail: most were all-rounders who performed a combination of roles, although "content strategist", "communications writer" and "rebranding tech" were also mentioned.

A spike in respondents with new jobs was first seen in 2021, with 31.7% of respondents reported being in their current position at their current organization for less than a year. In 2022, this number peaked at 36.8% - when respondents with new jobs outstripped the number who had held their current position for medium or long terms. In 2023, the number of respondents with new jobs has fallen again, to 20.3% - lower than in 2020 although still well above the 9% reported in 2019.

.. container:: question

   |icon-info| In the 2022 survey results, we saw more employee respondents in new positions - jobs that they'd held for less than one year - than in any previous survey. To better explore how the job market shake-up of the past few years is affecting our community - both employees and contractors - we added this new section for job changes in 2023.

   After community input in 2024, we changed the format of the question to ask about salary or earnings changes directly, rather than asking about changes in employment or contract status.

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Of the 713 respondents who worked as employees in the past year, 75% reported that their salary had increased in the past year. 22.3% reported no change, and 2.7% reported a decrease.

Among the 94 respondents who had worked on a contract basis, only 46.8% reported an earnings increase. 37.2% reported no change, and 16% reported a decrease.

Reasons for salary increase or decrease

.. raw:: html
   
   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| 

   Why did your salary increase? Select multiple, if appropriate.

   - I received or negotiated a raise
   - I was promoted within the same organization
   - I moved to another position within the same organization
   - I started a new position in a new organization
   - Other (please specify)

   OR

   Why did your salary decrease? Select multiple, if appropriate.

   - Organizational salary cuts
   - I was made redundant, downsized or laid off due to restructuring/bankruptcy/closure
   - My employment was terminated
   - I resigned
   - I moved to another position with the same organization at a lower salary
   - I started a new position in a new organization at a lower salary
   - Other (please specify)

   Regardless of outcome, did you attempt to negotiate a salary increase in the past year? This could be through formal or informal procedures.
   
   - yes
   - no

.. raw:: html

   </details>
   
61.6% of employees reporting an increase in salary attributed this to a raise. 17.4% received a promotion, and 13.9% started a new position.

After examining the responses entered by those respondents who selected "Other" and provided more detail, four additional options were added to the reasons for salary increase: 

- "Adjustment" refers to a salary increase to account for inflation, cost-of-living increases, currency exchange rates or similar - rather than a performance, merit or tenure-based raise;
- "Position change" refers to a change in location, increase in responsibilities or wider scope of tasks that warranted a salary increase, without actually being a promotion or lateral move;
- "Equity" refers to the maturation of stock options or other equity-based compensation increases; and
- "Bonus" refers to a one-time or annual bonus payment that was not part of the respondent's regular salary.

50% of employees reporting a decrease in salary attributed this to starting a new position at a lower salary. 20.8% were made redundant, 12.5% experienced organizational salary cuts, and 8.3% had their employment terminated.

There was only one "other" response for salary decrease, representing a potentially common option which was added:

-  "Relocation" refers to a decrease in salary due to a move to a location with a lower cost of living or lower salary expectations.

32.8% of employees attempted to negotiate a salary increase in the past year.

Of those contractors reporting an increase in their earnings, 36.5% raised their rate, 34.9% started new contracts or projects, and 14.3% worked more hours.

Four additional options were added to the reasons for contract earnings increase, based on responses entered by those who selected "Other" and provided more detail:

   - "Received a raise" - as distinct from "raised rate" - applies to those contactors who work a single contract in the manner of a regular employee, and received a raise from their client/employer;
   - "Job changes" to describe taking on additional responsibility or work scope within the same contract, leading to an increase in earnings;
   - "Bonus" for a one-off additional payment; and
   - "Promotion" for a change in role or responsibility - again applying to those contractors working a single contract in the manner of a regular employee.

Of those contractors reporting a decrease in their earnings, 20% reported that their pipeline dried up, 16% worked fewer hours, and 16% had a contract end prematurely.

Two new options were added to the reasons for earnings decrease, based on responses entered by those who selected "Other":

   - "Stopgap contracting" for those who took on contracts at a lower rate as a temporary measure after losing permanent employment, while searching for a new permanent position; and
   - "Relocation" for those who moved to a location with a lower cost of living or lower salary expectations.

45.7% of contractors reported that they attempted to negotiate a rate increase in the past year.

Employees and contractors who had indicated that they were currently unemployed were not shown this question. 

Around half of all employees (51.4%) and half of all contractors (50% exactly) reported that their confidence in their job security and stability was around the same as last year. However, while 26.6% of employees reported feeling more confident, only 19.7% of contractors did. Conversely, 21.9% of employees reported feeling less confident, compared to 30.3% of contractors.

Workplace
=========

The questions in this section relate to respondents' workplace: whether they work from home, from an office, or a combination, and how they feel about that. We were also interested in how the much-discussed "back to the office" mandates have affected our community. 

.. container:: note

   .. rubric:: |icon-info| Note on use of the term "remote"

   In previous surveys, this was some confusion as to the definition of the term "remote", as many people suddenly forced to work from home due to the pandemic did not think of that situation as working remotely. To clarify, we consider the word "remote" to have the same meaning as "work from home" or "home office".

Employee salary, benefits and satisfaction
==========================================

.. WRITE: "employee salary, benefits and satisfaction" intro

To protect the privacy of our community, we do not publish median salary figures for any region or category with less than 10 respondents. In previous years, this has meant that median salaries could only be given for a few regions and countries, and a handful of US states.     

With this year's survey amassing the highest number of submissions yet, we can now provide a more extensive range of salary breakdowns. Alongside the baseline data for Africa, which encompasses respondents from South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria, we have gathered enough data to publish median salaries (|50th| percentile) for 15 individual countries, 17 US states, 3 Canadian provinces (including separate figures for each province's largest city), and 3 Australian states.

In regions or categories meet the minimum threshold of 30 respondents, we're also providing the |25th| percentile (the value below which 25% of the data falls) and |75th| percentile (the value below which 75% of the data falls).

.. raw:: html

   </details>

In some locations, it is customary to discuss salary as a yearly figure, while in other it is more common to talk about monthly salaries. Respondents were asked to specify if they were entering a yearly or monthly figure, and all monthly salaries were multiplied by 12 to allow for comparison. In total, 81.1% of employee respondents chose to enter their salary as a yearly figure, with 18.9% choosing monthly.

As in previous years, salaries for those working part-time hours (less than 30 per week) have been omitted from the figures in this section. The median salaries are based on 922 full-time employee respondents.

.. container:: note

   .. rubric:: |icon-info| Definition of percentile values

   Previous survey results have only reported the median salary - the number in the middle of the range, sometimes referred to as the |50th| percentile. Due to the increase in numbers and finer-grained location data, we're able this year to also publish figures for the |25th| and |75th| percentile figures, for regions where there are more than 30 respondents. 

   In the following tables, the following definitions apply:

   - |25th| percentile: one quarter of all respondents earned less, three quarters earned more
   - |50th| percentile (median): half of all respondents earned more, half earned less
   - |75th| percentile: one quarter of all respondents earned more, three  quarters earned less

Median salary by respondent region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the range of socio-economic differences in the countries in the survey results, median salary figures broken down by country of residence of employee is more useful than overall median salary.

Median salary by gender identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. WRITE: median salary by gender identity  

Due to numbers, we are only able to break down salary by gender identity for women (59.9% of all respondents) and men (34.7% of all respondents). In almost every region, men earned more than women, by as much as 76% in Asia - although with such a small sample size that is unlikely to be truly representative. 

The only region where the median for women was higher was North America overall - but even here, the 75th percentile salary was higher for men, and when looking at the two largest countries in that region (the United States and Canada) men were paid more overall.

Employee benefits

   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| Does your salary package include any of the following statutory benefits?

   Labor laws in some countries mandate that employees receive some or all of the following benefits as part of their employment (in some cases depending on the size or type of employer).

   Please indicate if you have access to any of the following statutory benefits. Check all that apply, or select "none of the above".

   - Paid vacation
   - Paid parental leave
   - Paid sick leave
   - Healthcare benefits
   - Pension / superannuation / retirement
   - None of the above

   Does your salary package include any of the following statutory benefits, in excess of the required minimums?

   Please indicate if you receive any of the following benefits, in excess of any government-mandated minimums that may apply, as part of your salary package.

   Check all that apply, or select "none of the above".

   For example, in Germany, employees are legally entitled to 20 days of paid vacation per year. An employee living in Germany who has a paid vacation allowance of 30 days would therefore select "paid vacation" for this question, as they receive more than the government mandated minimum.

   - Paid vacation
   - Paid parental leave
   - Paid sick leave
   - Healthcare benefits
   - Pension / superannuation / retirement
   - I'm not sure
   - None of the above

   Does your salary package include any of the following non-statutory benefits?

   Check all that apply, or select "none of the above".

   - Time off or bonuses for community-related activities
   - 401(k) matching or equivalent (additional pension contributions)
   - Unlimited PTO (paid/personal time off)
   - Insurance e.g. life, accident, income protection
   - Stocks, shares, stock options, or equity
   - Commission or bonus payments
   - Professional development / ongoing education / conference budget
   - Meals, meal vouchers, or food-related benefits
   - Gym, fitness, sport, or other wellness-related benefits
   - Transportation-related benefits (company car, public transport passes, parking, fuel vouchers or reimbursements for any transport-related cost)
   - Home office or co-working office budget (including for laptops or other equipment)
   - Phone and/or internet-related benefits or reimbursements
   - Other (please specify)
   - None of the above

   <details><summary>Question background</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-info| 

   This question was overhauled in 2024 to distinguish between benefits that are mandated by law in the country of employment, and those that are provided by the employer in addition to what is legally required. Instead of one questoion asking about all benefits, we now ask three separate questions: one about statutory benefits, one about statutory benefits in excess of legal requirements, and one about non-statutory benefits.

   This question was overhauled in 2024 to be more positive in outlook. Rather than asking respondents to choose from a list of factors that may affect their satisfaction, we asked them to rate their agreement with a series of statements about their salary and benefits, job, workplace, team and organization.

Factors affecting salary satisfaction
-------------------------------------

.. IDEA: work out how to compare 2024 satisfaction data to previous years

35.1% of employee respondents - the largest group - said that they had no reasons for dissatisfaction with their salary and benefits. The next most-selected option was "salary is too low", with 30.5%.

As a result of 5 submissions in the "other" category, a new factor was added to these results, "No raises or adjustments for inflation", which will be included as an option for this question in 2024. It's worth noting that had this option been included in the question, other respondents may have selected it, so it's possible that this factor is affecting the industry more than these results would suggest.

   While the 2023 survey results include more contractors than in any previous year (79) this number is too low, and the respondents too geographically diverse, to determine median rates except for the very largest regions (the United States and Europe). Numbers are provided where possible, but it should be noted that the sample size is not large enough to provide meaningful insight. 

   For example, out of the 58 hourly rates entered, the highest value is 57 times higher than the lowest value. Even when only examining data for the United States, where 27 hourly rates were entered, the highest rate is 44 times higher than the lowest rate. Trying to segment these values further - by region, type of role, gender etc - results in numbers far too low to publish.

.. container:: question

   |icon-info| In the first few surveys, we often struggled with the wording to describe the group of respondents who are not employees - "contractors, freelance operators, and self-employed people" is cumbersome and doesn't really "roll off the tongue". While we often used "contractor" as a catch-all shorthand term, we were aware that this might not be the preferred term for everyone.

   In 2023, we asked respondents who are not employees what term they prefer to describe the kind of work they do. The results from that year indicated that "contractor" was the most widely-used term, so that's what we used as a shorthand term throughout 2023's results and in the survey form for 2024. 

   We'll continue to ask this question in future surveys to ensure that we're using the most appropriate term.

.. WRITE: preferred term results

For the first time this year, we asked those respondents who are not employees what term they use to describe the kind of work they do. 53.2% term themselves "contractors", while 27.8% prefer "self-employed" and 16.5% use "freelancer". Of those who chose "other", the two terms added were "agency" and "consultant".

Several contractor respondents indicated that they were contractors by necessity rather than choice, taking contracts either because they were unable to find a suitable employment offer, or anticipating an employment offer after a period of contracting.

   |icon-question| Comparing payment rates for contractors, freelancers and self-employed people is difficult due to the number of different ways that individuals in this group operate.

   To simplify this as much as possible while still allowing comparisons, please estimate one or more of the following rate types, even if you normally use a different fee structure.

   Don't include any VAT, GST or sales tax. If you normally charge different rates, enter your most common rate, or an average if you feel that is more representative.

Fee structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WRITE: fee structures

Comparing payment rates for contractors is difficult due to the number of different ways that individuals in this group operate. To simplify this as much as possible while still allowing comparisons, contractors were asked to estimate their hourly rate, day rate or monthly rate - or one of each type of rate, if appropriate - even if they normally used a different fee structure. Contractors charging multiple rates or in multiple currencies were asked to enter their most common rate, or an average if they felt that was more representative.  

The hourly rate was the most popular option, utilized by 73.4% of respondents (and exclusively by 41.8%). Next was monthly rates, entered by 43% of respondents (exclusively by 20.3%). Day rates were entered by 38% of respondents, but only exclusively by 6.3%.

41.8% of respondents entered a figure for all three fee structures. 8.9% entered both hourly and day rates, and there were no respondents entering only hourly and monthly, or only daily and monthly figures. 

Median hourly rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The median hourly rate across all regions (from 58 respondents) was USD $53. Drilling down to North America (34 respondents), that rises to USD $55, and this number stays the same when examining the United States only (27 respondents). 

Looking at Europe, the median hourly rate was USD $33 (19 respondents). No further splits are possible in this region. 

Median day rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The median day rate across all regions (30 respondents) was USD $447. Looking at North America only (12 respondents), this goes up to USD $465, and in the United States only (10 respondents) to USD $480.  

Looking only at Europe (13 respondents), the median day rate was USD $242.

Median monthly rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The median monthly rate across all regions (34 respondents) was USD $4,168. There were not enough monthly rate values entered to publish a figure for North America or the United States, but examining Europe only (20 respondents) the median was USD $3,519. No further breakdowns are possible.

.. container:: question

   |icon-info| 

   Pay transparency was first included in the 2022 survey. Due to feedback from contractors in this first year, pay transparency questions were only shown to employee respondents in 2023. However, as some contractors work long-term contracts for single clients in the manner of regular employees, pay transparency may still be relevant. 

   In 2024, we moved the pay transparency questions to the "organization demographics" section. Contractors were given the option of filling out this section or skipping it, depending on whether they deemed it relevant to their situation or not. The question about the legal requirement for pay transparency in the organization's location was also added.

.. container:: note

   .. rubric:: |icon-info| Pay transparency legislation

   A number of US states have made some level of pay transparency law - Maryland, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Rhode Island, Washington, California and New York - and a number of others are considering doing so. The exact requirements, level of compliance and enforcement mechanisms vary from state to state, and as most laws have only been enacted recently, it will take some time for the effects to be felt. An overview is available here: `Quick facts about state salary range transparency laws <https://www.americanprogress.org/article/quick-facts-about-state-salary-range-transparency-laws/>`_

   Additionally, The European Parliament approved a new Pay Transparency Directive in March 2023. EU member states have three years to enact legislation based on the directive, and several - including Sweden, Belgium, Poland, and Ireland - have already taken steps. Part of the directive involves measuring and eliminating any gender-based pay discrepancies. More information is available here: `Commission welcomes the political agreement on new EU rules for pay transparency <https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_7739>`_

Pay transparency policy and legal requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

47.6% of respondants - the majority - reported that their organization had no pay transparency policy. The next largest group, at 27.9%, were unsure if there was a policy or not. The final 24.5% were fairly evenly split between partial disclosure (9.5%), disclosure forbidden (8.3%), and full disclosure (6.7%).

The proportions of organizations in each category has not changed significantly over the three years we have asked this question.

We asked for the first time in 2024 if respondents were aware of the legal requirement for pay transparency in their organization's location. 44.6% were unsure, 42.9% reported that there was no legal requirement, and 12.5% said that pay transparency was legally required.

.. CHART: is there any useful way to chart respondent location data?

Survey feedback
===============

Following on from last year, we again included some questions about the survey itself.  

.. raw:: html
   
   <details><summary>What we asked</summary>

.. container:: question

   |icon-question| Have you participated in a WTD Salary Survey before?

   - Yes
   - No

   |icon-question| How strongly do you agree with the following statements about this survey? [Strongly agree] [Agree] [Neutral] [Disagree] [Strongly disagree]

   - The questions are relevant
   - The survey form and website are usable
   - The length of the survey is appropriate

.. raw:: html

   </details>

Half of respondents were repeat participants, with 50.1% having taken part in a previous survey.

Overall, most respondents were positive about the survey, with "Strongly agree" and "Agree" being the top options selected for each of the feedback rating scales. 2.7% felt that the length of the survey was not appropriate, and 0.6% felt the questions were not relevant. 3% expressed doubts about the usability of the survey form and website, undoubtedly caused by known issues with the performance and layout on mobile devices.
